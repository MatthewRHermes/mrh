# This is going to be a complicated overlapping set of code with the out-of-date, no-longer-supported QC-DMET by Sebastian Wouters,
# Hung Pham's code, and my additions or modifications

# I really shouldn't have to write, implicitly, mrh.dmet.dmet.dmet.  That's pretty ridiculous.  Let's alias that down

import dmet
dmet_object = dmet.dmet
